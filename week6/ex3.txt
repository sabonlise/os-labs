Round Robin produces larger waiting time and response time with comparison to other scheduling algorithms.
Advantage of this algorithm is that all jobs get equal share of CPU.
However, setting the quantum too short causes too many process switches and lowers the CPU efficiency, 
but setting it too long may cause poor response to short interactive requests. A quantum around
20â€“50 msec is often a reasonable compromise (from Tannenbaum).
