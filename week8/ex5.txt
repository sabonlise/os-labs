Virtual address is used to refer to the actual physical address, because physical address cannot be accessed directly.
While physical address is the actual location in memory, virtual address does not exist in memory.
Virtual address is needed to make each process run independently of each other (without corrupting memory), 
also it can handle more memory than it actually is in the system.
