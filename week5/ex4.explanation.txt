The timing results in this case are slightly worse than in the previous one, 
primarily because of the thread synchronization. Also, unlike in the previous exercise,
threads are not doing ideally equal computations, because some threads might be created
when another threads already did a lot of computations. This is especially noticable when
the N variable is not so big, and, as a result, most of the threads get created when calculations
are already finished or are close to it.
